        Assault: <br>
        This is what I always use when I'm using Assault class. <br>
        This method gives an advantage against any waves and makes you independent. What I mean by independent is that if you are the last one standing, you can easily clutch this. <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        Wave 1:<br>
        Buy Nothing
        <br> <br>
        Wave 2:<br>
        Buy Nothing
        <br><br>
        Wave 3:<br>
        Upgrade Assualt Rifle to Harpoon
        <br><br>
        This gives you the ability to hook non-boss enemies. So why would you want to hook enemies that could potentially kill you. Well Assault class comes with a Shovel. This shovel one shots enemy units with 100HP or lower. <br>
        With this information, you can combine the harpoon and the melee you have to become to the most deadly weapon. What you can do, you can hook enemy such as infantries to you, once they are hooked to you, they are stunned for 1s, you can switch to your melee and finish it off. <br>
        Keep in mind when you hook someone, you deal damage to the one you hooked. However, what if you hooked a gunner or a unit with more HP than 100? Well, you could Hook+Melee+HookAgain+Melee, you can repeat it as much as you want until it dies. As I said, it stuns them. <br>
         You can follow this step below to better help you. <br>
         <br>
         HP: 100 or Lower: Hook > Melee
         <br>
         HP: Higher than 100: Hook > Melee (repeat until dead.)
        <br><br>
        Wave 4:<br>
        Buy the Crying rally. For Damage reduction.
        <br><br>
        Wave 5:<br>
        Buy RPG
        <br><br>
        Wave 6:<br>
        Upgrade RPG to Shockwave
        <br><br>
        Wave 7-10: <br>
        You can either buy Jetpack to Terminal Velocity for better mobility or buy nothing. You can spend your Reserves on anything beyond this wave.
